Go documentation states that
    Sort has time complexity O(n*log(n))
    Stable has time complexity O(n*log(n)*log(n))
Source: pkg.go.dev/sort#Sort

We would expect Stable to increase exponentially in completion time due to its higher complexity

When we run question 2 with very large values, such as 100,000, we get the following results:
Sort duration for Slice:  25.099862ms
Stable duration for Slice:  411.334Âµs

Although both programs are executing rather quickly, you can see that the Stable function is taking
 much more time than the Sort function.

 Therefore, my observation of the behavior of the program DOES follow Big-O time analysis of
 Sort and Stable from the Go official documentation, for large values of n where n=len(slice).
